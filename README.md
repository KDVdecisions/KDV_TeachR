# KDV_TeachR
Small demonstration scripts from my R workshops and book clubs.

These are material I pull from and modify when teaching my R workshops and hosting R book clubs.  Most files includes a small case study, some simulated data, at least one worked example, and then some suggested exercises.  Answers are NOT provided for the exercises.

I teach R courses through [Transmitting Science](https://www.transmittingscience.com) and [private customized workshops](http://www.kdv-decisions.com/courses.html), usually Intro to R, Tidyverse, Shiny, Spatial Data, and environmental or ecological themed topics.  My students are primarily scientists who use R in their research and wish to become more proficient at tasks such as:

  * understand and modify code they already use
  * visually and interactively communicate their research
  * efficiently manage increasing volume of digital data
  * improve reproducibility of their research
